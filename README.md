Here's some of the samples that I obtained.

This project focuses on recreating the image given in the style of another image given. This is an implementation of <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576'>this</a> paper.

The crux of the paper focuses on how the information is represented in the intermediate layers of a Convolutional Neural Network (like VGG-19). The information stored in these intermediate layers helps us in making this new image.
